    "FINAL IDEA FOR REFERENCE:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Looking at time series data from NHL draft pics since 1960s. Over the years, there has been a drastic change in the style of hockey being played in the NHL. The 70s through the 90s were all about the biggest and baddest teams intimidating competition with shear size. With increasing european (initially russian), influence in the NHL, the game is being played with more skill and speed. Our hypothesis is that the top draft pics each year have been on average, lighter and shorter than they have been in the past. There are many data sources that provide this data and is downloadable for free as a csv file or we can web scrape data from the NHL roster website.\"\n",

    "Recognize any people or online resources that you found helpful. These can be tutorials, software packages, Stack Overflow questions, peers, and data sources. Showing gratitude is a great way to feel happier! But it also has the nice side-effect of reassuring us that you're not passing off someone else's work as your own. Crossover with other courses is permitted and encouraged, but it must be clearly stated, and it must be obvious what parts were and were not done for 2950. Copying without attribution robs you of the chance to learn, and wastes our time investigating."
