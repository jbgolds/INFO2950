    "\"Looking at time series data from NHL draft pics since 1960s. Over the years, there has been a drastic change in the style of hockey being played in the NHL. The 70s through the 90s were all about the biggest and baddest teams intimidating competition with shear size. With increasing european (initially russian), influence in the NHL, the game is being played with more skill and speed. Our hypothesis is that the top draft pics each year have been on average, lighter and shorter than they have been in the past. There are many data sources that provide this data and is downloadable for free as a csv file or we can web scrape data from the NHL roster website.\"\n",

Additionally we because the \"height\" category is a string, we will have to convert that column to an integer representing inches in order to calculate the difference over the years. Finally, certain players height is ommitted from the data set which we will either have to fill or remove them from the dataset. There are also osme missing data points as can see above. We will have to see how many are missing and see if we can manually fill them in if available. "
